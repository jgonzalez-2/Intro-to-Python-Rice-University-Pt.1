# Problem 6
# The area of a circle is πr^2 where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a cricle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π = 3.14.

pi = 3.14
radius = 8
areaCircle = pi * radius ** 2

print areaCircle
