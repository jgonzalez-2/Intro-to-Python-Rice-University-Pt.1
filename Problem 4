# Problem 4
# The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

length = 7
height = 4
area = length * height

print area
