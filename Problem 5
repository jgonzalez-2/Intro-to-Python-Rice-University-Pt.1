# Problem 5
# The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14.

pi = 3.14
radius = 8
circumference = (2 * pi * radius)

print circumference
